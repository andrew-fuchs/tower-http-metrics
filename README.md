[![CI](https://github.com/andrew-fuchs/tower-http-metrics/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/andrew-fuchs/tower-http-metrics/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A [Tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) middleware that tracks
HTTP server metrics with the [Metrics](https://metrics.rs/) facade
library.

## 0.0 Release

I needed to make something I could drop into my projects without
reimplementing it each time.

Since this is a 0.0 release, consider this package to be untested.
API/ABI stability is not guaranteed.
